# Welcome to mathystuff!
This is probably going to be a very useless repository.  As I have realized
my lack of fundamental knowledge of mathematics, I decided to start with
Khan Academy.

The code here will be me wrapping my head around various concepts I never
learned (but should have) and turning them into a language I know.

profanity in anything public, so..
